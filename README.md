## MORGAN: To Bridge Mixture of Experts and Spectral Graph Neural Network

Welcome to the official code repository for `MORGAN: To Bridge Mixture of Experts and Spectral Graph Neural Network`, accepted at AAAI 2025. 

### Installation
The code is implemented in PyTorch. To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To modify the configurations of the experiments, please refer to `config.py`. You can change the `dataset`/`model`/`optimization` and other hyperparameters in the configuration file. To run the code, please execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Dataset
Some datasets are too large and could not be uploaded. For the full dataset, you can find from https://github.com/Hsu1023/SLOG
